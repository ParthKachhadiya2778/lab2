# Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset Analysis

This repository contains Python code for building a machine learning model to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The model is trained using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast mass, which describe characteristics of cell nuclei present in the image.

The dataset contains the following features:
- Radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension for each of the three cell nucleus features: mean, standard error, and worst.
